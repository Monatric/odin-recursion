make a merge_sort method
  takes 3 parameters: an array, lowest index, and highest index. arr, low, high names respectively
  X(try muna walang parameter)
  
  if low less than high
    mid = (low + high) / 2 [to divide the array into half]
    merge_sort(arr[low..mid])
    merge_sort(arr mid+1 to high)
    merge()

make a merge method
  takes arrays parameter named arr1, arr2
  i = 0, j = 0, k = 0, result = []
  while i <= arr1.size && j <= arr2.size
    if arr1[i] < arr2[j]
      result << arr1[i]
      k += 1
      i += 1
    else
      result << arr2[j]
      k += 1
      j += 1
    end
  end

  while i <= arr1.size
    result << arr1[i]
    i += 1
  end

  while j <= arr2.size
    result << arr2[j]
    j += 1
  end
  result
end

second attempt for merge method

def merge()

end
